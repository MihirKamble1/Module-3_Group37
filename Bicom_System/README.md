# ABOUT:
* The Bicom System is all about the bi-directional transmission of the data between the user interface and the Car , which probably makes the system more advance and more friendly to the user, It is all about making the particular ECU totally contact-less and by finding the profined method for the success.
* Keyless entry systems are used to remotely lock, unlock and start your car’s engine using RF signals. There are two types of keyless entry systems: active and passive. Active systems send a signal to the receiver in the car, and the system disarms.
* The RF modules are used in both the transmitting and receiving circuits and communication between these circuits are coded. Quartz crystal vibrators are used in these RF modules.
