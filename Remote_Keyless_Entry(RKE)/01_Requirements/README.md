## Remote Keyless Entry
* Remote keyless entry (RKE) is an electronic access system that can be controlled from a distance. RKEs, which are typically used to remotely lock or unlock doors, require the end user to initiate an action that will cause a physical or software key fob to transmit a radio signal to a receiver that controls an electronic lock. Typically, the action is to press a button on a physical fob. 
* A remote keyless entry car kit doesn’t rely on a physical button or panel in order to get into your vehicle, but instead it has a sensor that detects your remote keyless key fob within a certain range of your vehicle. It then unlocks once you touch the door handle, but only while the key is nearby. Remote keyless entry cars also often allow for remote starting, as long as the remote key fob is within a short distance of the vehicle. 
* Remote keyless communications are done through encrypted radio signals, and this can either be done through short range radio to a remote key fob in your pocket, or it can be hooked up to a smartphone system and can actually be controlled over cellular networks from anywhere in the world.

## Requirements
### High-Level Requirements
  |ID|Description|
  |---|---|
  | HLR01 | It Should function accordingly towards locking and Unlocking the door |

  ## SWOT Analysis
  ![SWOT](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98813646/157853215-1b9bdbb0-39c1-462a-8877-b8bbcc2f0884.PNG)

  ### Strength
  * The Security system here making a difference.
  * There is no human interaction involved.
  * All Functions can be remotely handled with a button press. 
  ### Weakness
  * The Range is a one of the weakness.
  * The Status of the car will be unknown.
  * The Peripherals being used makes the ECU a complex controllable unit.
  ### Opportunities
  * The Latest trend for an EV in the global market defines the opportunity.
  * The digital world needs an modified and more convenient ways.
  * The more the safety the more will be the demand. 
  ### Threats
  * Once a program is being initialized the user has to wait till the completion. and then the second program will be executed 
  * which accordingly takes time and may impact negatively.

## 5W's And 1H
### Who
* owner of the vehicle
### What
* Keyless entry systems are used to remotely lock, unlock and can have various features
### When
* Within a range of distance a button is pushed, it provides an programmable signal frequency by radio waves to the receiver unit in the car, which locks or unlocks the door And does the required task.
### Where
* Placed as an ECU component in the Car for the security purpose and using safety precaution to function using contactless interaction with cars 
### Why
* remote keyless entry systems alarm the vehicle against theft and lock and unlock the doors
### How
* Keyless entry to a vehicle is usually attained by sending a radio frequency signal from a remote transmitter to the receiver in the car
